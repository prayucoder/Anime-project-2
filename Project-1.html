                            his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount
                            of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked,
                            hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy 's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure.
                            Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted

                            that there’s more to the supernatural world than the everyday specter. Vengeful spirits known as Hollows roam the world in search of devouring souls, and Shinigami – soul reapers – work tirelessly to defeat them and guide normal
                            ghosts into a place called Soul Society. Ichigo valiantly fights the Hollow that threatens his sisters, but on the verge of defeat a Shinigami named Rukia gives him her powers, turning him into a Shinigami himself. Ichigo must
                            now adjust to his new life of both vanquishing and saving souls for the sake of Soul Society.</p>
